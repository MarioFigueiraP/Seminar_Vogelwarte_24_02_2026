# Seminar Vogelwarte (24-02-2026)

This seminar explores **spatial and spatio-temporal models**, with a particular focus on **recursive and distributed inference**. We review foundational concepts, emphasizing **areal models**, and discuss modern extensions such as **Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) and Intrinsic CAR (ICAR) models**, as well as some lesser-known extensions of the Proper CAR model. The seminar also highlights **compositional spatial data analysis** and addresses challenges arising from the **curse of big data**. Key topics include **methodological and computational challenges**, such as **efficient Bayesian inference**, **information sharing across models**, and strategies for **partitioning data and models to enable efficient distributed inference**.
